# Remove Header Junk

A simple plugin that removes the unneccessary junk that WordPress adds to the header.

If you ever view the source of your WordPress blog, youâ€™ll notice that WordPress adds a bunch of [unnecessary junk](http://gomakethings.com/remove-junk-from-the-wordpress-header/) into the header. Keep your markup clean and free of junk. Forked from [Scotch.io](http://scotch.io/quick-tips/cms/wordpress/removing-wordpress-header-junk).
